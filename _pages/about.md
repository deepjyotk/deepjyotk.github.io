I am Deepjyot, a CS grad student at NYU. I am a dedicated and persistent software engineer, passionate about continuously advancing my technological expertise. With a steadfast "never give up" attitude, I thrive on tackling challenges and learning new skills to deliver impactful solutions. My commitment is reflected in my successful projects, such as the widely downloaded "Marwar Print" app, and my proactive role in full-stack development at Cognizant. Follow my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/deepjyotk) and read my insights on [Medium](https://medium.com/@kapoordeepjyotsingh29).

As a hobby, I love diving into competitive coding 🧑‍💻 and playing badminton 🏸—both fuel my passion for challenges and precision!
