title: BankingProto
description: This project is a simulation of a banking application developed using gRPC in Java. The application demonstrates the use of gRPC for client-server communication, ensuring efficient, scalable, and high-performance interactions. The project is structured with clean code principles and includes proper integration tests between the client and server applications.

    Technologies Used: Java 21, gRPC, Protocol Buffers, Maven, JUnit(Testing)

### Features

1. Users can request for account balance.
2. Users can withdraw money from their account.
3. Users can deposit money to their account.
4. Users can transfer money from one account to another.

### Benefits of gRPC

1. High Performance: gRPC uses HTTP/2 for transport, which supports multiplexing multiple requests over a single connection, reducing latency and improving throughput.
2. Strongly Typed Contracts: With Protocol Buffers (protobuf), gRPC ensures type safety and contract enforcement, reducing errors and providing clear API documentation.
3. Language Agnostic: gRPC supports multiple programming languages, allowing different parts of the application to be written in different languages while still communicating seamlessly.
4. Streaming: gRPC supports streaming in both directions, enabling real-time data exchange and long-lived connections.
5. Efficient Serialization: Protocol Buffers are highly efficient for both serialization and deserialization, resulting in smaller message sizes and faster processing.
6. Built-in Load Balancing and Retries: gRPC has built-in support for load balancing and automatic retries, enhancing the reliability of distributed systems
